<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio website!

  My name is Harsh Tiwari, and I'm a computer science student with a strong passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). I believe in the limitless possibilities that technology offers, and I'm excited to explore and contribute to this ever-evolving field.
  
  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of hobbies that fuel my creativity and keep me inspired. I love traveling to new places, immersing myself in different cultures, and discovering the beauty of our world. Whether it's exploring breathtaking landscapes or getting lost in the bustling streets of a new city, I find travel to be an enriching experience that broadens my horizons.
  
  Apart from traveling, I have a deep love for the performing arts. Dancing and singing have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. These forms of expression allow me to channel my emotions, connect with others, and find joy in the rhythm and melodies that surround us. They serve as a perfect counterbalance to the logical and analytical aspects of my computer science studies.
  
  My journey into the world of AI and ML began with a genuine curiosity and has since transformed into a burning passion. The potential to create intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and make informed decisions fascinates me. I constantly strive to enhance my knowledge and skills in this field through continuous learning, hands-on projects, and staying up to date with the latest advancements.
  
  This portfolio website showcases my work, projects, and experiences, providing you with a glimpse into my journey as a computer science student and an AI enthusiast. I invite you to explore the various sections and delve into the projects I've undertaken. If you have any questions, collaboration opportunities, or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always excited to engage in meaningful conversations and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
